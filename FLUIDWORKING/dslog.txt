Integration started at T = 0 using integration method DASSL
(DAE multi-step solver (dassl/dasslrt of Petzold modified by Dynasim))
Error: The following error was detected at time: 1086.404222420815

Model error - Modelica.Math.log ((Thi-Tci)/(Tho-Tco)) = Modelica.Math.log (-1070.36)

Solver will attempt to handle this problem.
